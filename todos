#TODO Logs

* Check for Internal history Searching Bug *
* Check for expense Amangemnet Bug
* Add the Return Utilities

#Future Possibilities

* Loading complete history log as we do now,
  would be stupid as it could have lakhs of enteries
  and Qtable widget would take days to load all of it
  so, the history management should have a log
  display limit.
